                                <div>E-bikes have exploded in popularity in recent years and cyclists now have plenty of
                                    options when it comes to choosing the best e-bike for their needs, with options for
                                    everything from e-bike mountain bikes to e-bike cruiser bikes. </div>
                                <div>&#160;</div>
                                <div>Tenways is headquartered in the Netherlands and rolled out its first bike in 2021
                                    after a successful crowdfunding campaign. According to Tenways, their goal is to
                                    “make daily commuting effortless, speedy, eco-friendly, and fun.”</div>
                                <div>&#160;</div>
                                <div>As alluded to by its mission statement, Tenways bikes are focused on the cruiser
                                    and commuter and are not performance bikes to take into the mountains or on extreme
                                    off-road adventures. </div>
                                <div>&#160;</div>
                                <div>The Tenways CGO600 Pro is part of their “City Commuter” Collection, along with two
                                    other bikes: the CGO600 and the CGO800S. The City Commuter line is designed for just
                                    that - to assist cyclists in enjoying an assisted commute on local, paved roads.
                                </div>
                                <div>&#160;</div>
                                <div>The CGO600 Pro and the CGO800S are quite similar, but the CGO600 Pro looks the most
                                    like a conventional cruiser bike and is nearly ten pounds lighter than the 800S.
                                </div>
                                <div>&#160;</div>
                                <div>Tenways also has a “City Explorer” Collection, which features the AGO X and AGO T
                                    models. The City Explorer line is advertised as being able to handle both local
                                    commutes and head into more varied terrain such as dirt roads and bigger hills.

                                <div>The CGO600 Pro we had on test arrives in a standard cardboard bike box with the
                                    rear wheel and drive train fully assembled but the front wheel, handlebars, pedals,
                                    mudguards, and battery uninstalled. </div>
                                <div>&#160;</div>
                                <div>If you have experience in assembling bikes, it takes about 30 minutes total to get
                                    everything secured correctly and Tenways provides a clear manual with detailed
                                    photos to guide you through the process as well as clearly marked tools in a neatly
                                    packed box. </div>
                                <div>&#160;</div>
                                <div>Should you not have experience putting together a bike, it might take a bit longer.
                                    For example, securing the handlebars was a bit tricky as was adjusting the front
                                    hydraulic disc brake. You could always work with a local bike shop to have the
                                    e-bike assembled for a fee if you didn’t want to fuss with assembly at all.</div>
                                <div>&#160;</div>
                                <div>The small screen that shows which assist mode the bike is in (of which there are
                                    four) took a bit longer to learn, and the manual was much-needed here. </div>
                                <div>&#160;</div>
                                <div>Ultimately, the screen can be toggled to show different layouts that share trip
                                    distance, battery charge, remaining range given the battery charge, speed, Bluetooth
                                    connection, and total distance the bike has traveled in its lifetime. The rider even
                                    has an option to set a passcode to protect their data if they choose. </div>
                                <div>&#160;</div>
                                <div>Finally, while not required for use of the bike, Tenways has an app that cyclists
                                    can use to log their rides, see how fast they are going, and register their bike
                                    with Tenways.</div>

                                    cruiser bike, with the only giveaway about its e-bike nature being the battery that
                                    locks into the downtube, but even that would require a close look to see.</div>
                                <div>&#160;</div>
                                <div>There is a small screen on the left of the handlebars that serves as the rider’s
                                    way of switching between assist modes and checking their ride and bike data. Buttons
                                    that require only the use of a thumb or single finger to toggle between screens are
                                    easily located for use when riding, but the screen is quite small and hard to read,
                                    especially if you’re trying to glance at any info while also keeping an eye on the
                                    road ahead. </div>
                                <div>&#160;</div>
                                <div>The bottom bracket is fully-sealed, which means that it will be well-protected and
                                    can, in most cases, go for many years without needing to be serviced or cleaned.

                                <div>The bike comes with a single-speed drivetrain, Gates CDN carbon belt, and a Gates
                                    CDX crankset. The CGO600 Pro does not use a chain, and instead opts for the carbon
                                    belt. According to Tenways, the belt should net a rider nearly 19,000 miles before
                                    the greaseless belt needs to be serviced - a much greater range than a standard bike
                                    chain (approximately 3,000 miles). The front “chainring” has 60 teeth and the rear
                                    cassette has 22 teeth.</div>

                                <div>The frame weighs in at 37 pounds (41 when completely built up with the battery),
                                    which is a good number heavier than some other options, such as the Islabikes eJanis
                                    cruiser bike, which weighs in at just below 30 pounds. The CGO600 Pro does have a
                                    “walk” assist mode, should you want to walk next to the bike, but this mode is
                                    dependent on having battery power (as are all of the modes). The bike would be quite
                                    heavy and cumbersome to lift or walk with if the battery died mid-ride. </div>

                                <div>As with nearly all e-bikes, the CGO600 Pro comes with hydraulic disc brakes, and the ones on the Tenway are manufactured by TEKTRO. Not as notable as SRAM or Shimano, but a quick internet search shows that TEKTRO has been in the “braking industry” since 1986 and is well-versed in creating hydraulic disc brakes that work. </div>

                                <div>The bike comes standard with 700c wheels and tires that are made by CST tires and supposedly puncture-proof, but we all know that no tire is truly exempt from the errant shard of glass or metal. The tires were surprisingly grippy and have deep treads to help on slick roads or a short bit of gravel or compressed dirt here and there. </div>

                                <div>Unfortunately, the bike does not come with a seat-tube or down-tube water bottle mount, so a rider would need to get creative with some zip ties if they wanted to mount a bottle cage on either of those sections (while being mindful that the battery takes up nearly the entire downtube).</div>

                                <div>The 350W motor and 53-mile-range battery make the CGO600 Pro more than suitable for daily commutes or local romps that include a few hills or strenuous sections - up to 15-degree hills, according to Tenways. </div>

The battery takes approximately 4.5 hours to achieve a full charge from a drained state. A battery sign in the upper section of the integrated computer screen gives riders an on-demand look at the bike’s battery levels, ranging from no bars (less than 5% battery) to five bars (75% charged or more).</div>

Tenways bikes do have EN15194 certification, which according to the brand, is the “European version” of the UL2849 certification. The brand is hoping to receive UL2271 certification by the end of 2023 and UL2849 certification in 2024. </div>

                                </div>
                                <div>I took the CGO600 Pro on my local bike path which connects with some quiet neighborhood roads, a route similar to what some might experience in a daily bike commute. As someone who bike commuted 15-20 miles a day for two years, I was eager to see if the CGO600 Pro was an upgrade from the 10-speed roadie I used to bomb around on. </div>
                                <div>&#160;</div>
                                <div>The overall comfort on the bike is solid; some may want to swap out the wide, recreational riding-style bike seat for a less bulky one, but overall, the geometry of the bike fit me well (I rode a size medium frame and am 5’11) and I thought the top tube length and handlebar length were especially nice for a taller rider like me.</div>
                                <div>&#160;</div>
                                <div>The bike’s torque sensor worked like a charm and oscillated between levels one, two, and three perfectly and had no noticeable gap in taking the power from my pedal strokes and complementing them with the appropriate assistance from the motor. This made cornering and ascending rolling hills a dream; you almost forget you are riding an e-bike thanks to its seamless torque sensor and application of “boost” from the motor. </div>

                                <div>The greaseless, chainless drivetrain was incredibly quiet, and it was nice to know I could mount and dismount the bike without worrying about getting nasty grease on my clothes; a critical component if you are commuting to work and have an important presentation to show up for!</div>
                                <div>&#160;</div>
                                <div>Where the CGO600 Pro struggled a bit was maintaining speed - while understandably the motor is only boosting you when you apply torque on the pedals, the bike very quickly slowed down if you stopped pedaling to coast for a bit. This is a good incentive to pedal for your entire cruise, but can be annoying as the deceleration is noticeable fairly immediately and would make pausing your pedal strokes a frustrating experience. </div>
                                <div>&#160;</div>
                                <div>This is a small ding, but the rubber grippers on the flat handlebar were a bit uncomfortable on bare hands. The grippers have many very small lugs of rubber to prevent slipping off the handles, but the lugs dig into the palms the longer you ride; I recommend riding with gel-infused cycling gloves to mitigate this. </div>

                                    <h5>TENWAYS CGO600 PRO: VALUE AND CONCLUSION</h5>
                                    <div>&#160;</div>
                                </div>
                                <div>The CGO600 Pro is priced at $1,699 (on sale at the time of publication from $1,899) and featured a special deal at the time of publication which included two free mudguards and a free kickstand with the purchase of the bike. This puts the CGO600 Pro right on the market standard for what many quality commuter e-bikes are currently priced at. </div>
                                <div>&#160;</div>
                                <div>According to Tenways’ shipping policy, all shipping is currently free, but currently Tenways only ships to the 48 contiguous states in the United States, and does not ship to Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, or anywhere else outside of the United States. </div>
                                <div>&#160;</div>
                                <div>Tenways offers a 14-day free trial on all of their bikes. You can return any of their e-bikes for any reason within 14-days of purchase for a full refund. There are a smattering of stores nationwide where you can test ride Tenways bikes, as well. </div>
                                <div>&#160;</div>
                                <div>The CGO600 Pro is very reasonably priced when compared to other commuter-style e-bikes, many of which fall in the $1400-2,000 range. The fact that its battery is removable, has a 53-mile range and 350W motor, and can handle reasonable hills make the steed very difficult to argue with. </div>
                                <div>&#160;</div>
                                <div>Its drawbacks are that it is heavier than some other commuter-style e-bikes on the market, takes a smidge longer than other bikes to assemble (especially if you have limited knowledge of bike parts), and has a difficult-to-read integrated bike computer and a limited app.</div>
                                <div>&#160;</div>
                                <div>All that being said, the CGO600 Pro is an elevated commuter and cruiser bike that makes a strong case to eliminate the use of a car to get from Point A to Point B daily. The bike is comfortable, easy to use once set up, and has an ideal mileage range and limited maintenance needs for the average bike commuter, all for a reasonable price. </div>
                                <div>&#160;</div>
