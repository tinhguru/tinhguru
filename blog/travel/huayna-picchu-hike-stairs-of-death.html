                                                        at times, but it’s hands down one of the best things to do in

                                                        here over the years, and overall it’s quite safe as long as you

                                                    <p>The Huayna Picchu hike is a scenic trail that takes you up a

                                                        medieval Inca empire.</p>
                                                    <p>It’s a bit challenging, but entirely non-technical, and fit
                                                        hikers can reach the top of the mountain in 1 hour or less. The
                                                        steepest staircases are at the end of the hike, near the summit.

                                                        several months in advance to get a spot.</p>

                                                        the Huayna Picchu ‘Stairs of Death’ — and the final summit!<br>

                                                    <p>It’s time for the Machu Picchu ‘Stairs of Death’! This epic stone
                                                        staircase is your final challenge before reaching the summit of
                                                        Huayna Picchu mountain.</p>
                                                    <p>In spite of the scary name, you’re really not in imminent danger
                                                        here and the path is plenty wide. Don’t get me wrong though, the
                                                        views are dizzying!</p>
                                                    <p>There are steep drop-offs, but they’re not as close as they seem.
                                                        Even if you somehow fell off the stairway, you would land on one
                                                        of the grassy terraces with room to spare.</p>
                                                    <p>It’s not known how many steps there are in total, but many of
                                                        them are irregularly shaped and quite stubby, so you may not
                                                        always be able to fit your whole foot on them.</p>
                                                    <p>The traffic on this stairway only goes in one direction (up), and
                                                        there are several places to step off the trail and let other
                                                        hikers pass, so you don’t need to rush through it.</p>
                                                    <p>The Huayna Picchu ‘death stairs’ were my favorite part of the
                                                        whole hike. We must have spent the better part of an hour here,
                                                        just soaking up the views and trying to take pictures that
                                                        capture the vertigo-inducing scene. </p>

                                                    <p>The Huayna Picchu altitude is 2,693 meters (8,835 ft), and you
                                                        have spectacular views of Machu Picchu and the zigzag

                                                        usually a ranger stationed at the top to make sure people aren’t

                                                    <p>This passage is very small at the entrance, so you might have to

                                                        expected it to be harder based on things we’d read online.</p>
                                                    <p>The main difficulty at Huayna Picchu is the steepness of the
                                                        stairs and also the altitude, which makes it harder to get your
                                                        breath. However, if you’ve already spent a couple days
                                                        acclimating in Peru, then the altitude shouldn’t be a big

                                                        recent years. In the past, the loop section near the summit was
                                                        hiked in the opposite direction, meaning you’d walk down the

                                                        We did this hike and several others in January, and had fine
                                                        weather. The rain usually comes in the afternoons or evenings,
                                                        but bring a poncho just in case.</p>
                                                    <p>In my opinion, the best time of day to climb Huayna Picchu is in
                                                        the late morning. This is usually when the morning mist clears,
                                                        giving you better views of the Andes mountains.<br>

                                                            This is an iconic multi-day hike in Peru that takes 1-7 days

                                                            originally built by the Incas.</li>

                                                            it’s very rarely climbed now. Hopefully the path will be
