                                <div>People strive to lose weight for myriad reasons, and many fall into the fad diet
                                    trap promising real results fast. While there are certainly ways to accelerate your
                                    weight loss efforts, it’s important to understand that shedding pounds too quickly
                                    can actually backfire.</div>
                                <div>&#160;</div>
                                <div>Like so many parts of life, safe, successful and sustainable weight loss is more
                                    about the journey and less about a scale-based destination and rapidly approaching
                                    deadline. Read on for expert advice on the best ways to lose weight—and keep it off.

                                    <h1 style="padding-bottom: 1rem;">Why Losing Weight Fast Isn’t the Best Goal</h1>
                                </div>
                                <div>&#160;</div>
                                <div>Though the allure of the “lose 5 pounds in a week” diet myth is strong, there are
                                    many reasons why speedy shedding may actually work against your best weight loss
                                    efforts.</div>
                                <div>&#160;</div>
                                <div>First, when people lose weight rapidly, especially via fad or crash diets, they are
                                    typically unable to maintain it because the weight they lose is often more muscle
                                    mass and water and less fat mass compared to people who lose weight gradually.</div>
                                <div>&#160;</div>
                                <div>“Maintaining lean muscle is important in weight loss because it plays a key role in
                                    metabolism,” says certified health coach and author of Sugar Shock and Beyond Sugar
                                    Shock Connie Bennett. “Muscle helps you burn more calories. But when you lose weight
                                    too quickly, you lose muscle and your body slows down calorie burning. Fast weight
                                    loss can even cause permanent slowing of metabolism.”</div>
                                <div>&#160;</div>
                                <div>Rapid weight loss often leads to the dreaded yo-yo weight cycling many chronic
                                    dieters experience. In fact, a study of former contestants on NBC’s weight loss
                                    television show “The Biggest Loser” found the more pounds dropped quickly, the more
                                    the participant’s metabolism slowed. The study also found that the contestants
                                    regained a substantial amount of their lost weight in the six years following the
                                    competition.</div>
                                <div>&#160;</div>
                                <div>Another Australian study of 200 participants in The Lancet found that while dieters
                                    in the study lost the same amount of weight, the group that lost weight slowly lost
                                    10% more body fat and 50% less lean muscle than the rapid weight loss group</div>
                                <div>&#160;</div>
                                <div>Further compounding the issue, when people lose weight rapidly, appetite often
                                    increases as metabolism decreases, making it almost impossible to keep the pounds
                                    off. A study in Obesity reports our bodies prompt us to eat 100 calories more per
                                    day for every pound lost</div>
                                <div>&#160;</div>
                                <div>Popular fad diets also very often result in nutrient deficiencies. “And rapid
                                    weight loss—especially when you cut carbs—is often largely water,” says registered
                                    dietitian Ellen Albertson, Ph.D., author of Rock Your Midlife. “What’s more, if
                                    daily calories are low, the body may also use muscle mass as fuel, further reducing
                                    metabolism, as muscle mass is metabolically active.</div>
                                <div>&#160;</div>
                                <div>The bottom line: Shedding weight sensibly is the way to go. Experts usually say a
                                    safe rate is losing around half a pound to 2 pounds a week. With that goal in mind,
                                    here are some tried-and-true ways to drop pounds and keep them off for good.</div>

                                    <h1 style="padding-bottom: 1rem; font-weight: 500;">15 Tips for Safe and Sustainable
                                        Weight Loss,
                                        According to Experts</h1>
                                </div>

                                        Lifestyle and Behavior
                                        Changes</h2>
                                </div>

                                <div>When trying to lose weight, ban the word “diet,” suggests Albertson. Dieting can be
                                    unpleasant and make you hungry, so you constantly think about food, which is exactly
                                    what you don’t want when trying to lose weight. Instead, she recommends thinking of
                                    weight loss as a part of getting healthier and concentrating on taking care of your
                                    body first.</div>
                                <div>&#160;</div>
                                <div>“Weight loss is complicated and you don’t have total control over the number on the
                                    scale, but you do have control over what you eat, how much you move and other
                                    factors that impact weight, such as stress and sleep,” says Albertson. She suggests
                                    setting SMART—specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-sensitive—goals
                                    and rewarding yourself when you hit them.</div>
                                <div>&#160;</div>

                                <div>
                                    <h2 style="padding-bottom: 1rem; font-weight: bold;">2. Focus on the First 5% to 10%
                                    </h2>
                                </div>
                                <div>&#160;</div>
                                <div>Instead of saying, “I need to lose 25 pounds,” and overwhelming yourself with what
                                    seems like an impossible goal, look toward the health benefits that can come from
                                    even modest weight loss.</div>
                                <div>&#160;</div>
                                <div>“Set smaller, achievable targets,” suggests Bennett. “Losing only 5% to 10% of your
                                    total body weight (TBW) can greatly improve your health and lower your risk for

                                    as sugary snacks, processed carbs and soft drinks. When you avoid or cut back on

                                <div>One of the easiest ways to shed weight is to up your non-exercise activity
                                    thermogenesis (NEAT)—the energy expended for everything you do outside of

                                    instead of pushing a cart, parking farther away from the entrance to the mall,
                                    taking the stairs instead of the elevator or even tapping your toe can lead to
                                    hundreds of extra calories burned.</div>

                                    with standing leads to a greater daily energy expenditure, which directly

                                        results we desire from doing the above things actually occur during the anabolic

                                    <div>During the anabolic phase, the body builds muscle mass and loses fat mass while
                                        recovering from the stressor, explains Darnbrough. So, instead of pushing
                                        yourself to a breaking point, which ends up leading to overtraining and
                                        diminished results, put as much energy into rest and nutrition as you do into
                                        workouts. “To create sustainable results, try to balance your ratio of stress to

                                    <div>Research shows being accountable works. In one study, two-thirds of
                                        participants who joined a weight loss program with friends maintained their
                                        weight loss for six months after the meetings ended, compared to just a quarter
                                        of those who attended on their own[12]. Of course, many organizations also
                                        suggest having a sponsor or champion on your path to weight loss.</div>

                                    <div>“One of the best ways to consistently eat better and shed weight steadily is to
                                        check in every day with an accountability partner,” suggests Bennett. “Your
                                        accountability partner doesn’t need to be your bestie, favorite co-worker or
                                        partner. Just find someone with similar weight loss goals. You don’t need to
                                        talk every day, either. Just text each other to share that you’re eating healthy
                                        foods and staying on track. If you’re tempted by junk foods, you can lean on
                                        your partner, too. That’s when you may want to call them.”</div>

                                    <div>Couch surfers wanting to lose weight should turn off the TV—in fact, the more

                                    <div>One study that collected data from more than 50,000 middle-aged women over six
                                        years found that for every two hours the participants spent watching television
                                        each day, they had a 23% higher risk of obesity and a 14% higher risk of
                                        developing diabetes</div>

                                    <div>Excess television watching is correlated with extra pounds primarily because
                                        it’s a sedentary activity that often also leads to mindless eating. So, turn it
                                        off or maybe change the channel to an exercise program instead.</div>

                                    <div>Speaking of mindless eating, you can reprogram your brain for weight loss by
                                        tuning back into your body’s natural “I’m hungry” and “I’m full” cues.</div>

                                    <div>“Dieting combined with eating on the run or while multitasking—driving,
                                        watching TV, playing with your phone—can really disconnect you from your natural
                                        signals of hunger and satiety,” says Albertson. “Plus, as children, we also
                                        learned to clean our plates rather than eat until satisfied.” Add the fact that
                                        portion sizes have grown significantly—as much as 60% for things like snack
                                        foods— and the result is consistent overeating.</div>

                                    <div>“Instead, try to eat when you’re hungry and stop when you are satisfied rather
                                        than stuffed,” says Albertson. “Instead of tracking your food, try tracking how
                                        hungry you are before, during and after meals to get back in touch with these

                                    <div>Getting a good night’s sleep is one of the best things you can do to maintain a
                                        healthy weight and overall health. Studies show that poor sleep is associated
                                        with weight gain and other health disorders. When researchers analyzed 16 years’
                                        worth of data on 68,183 middle-aged American women, they found those who slept
                                        no more than five hours per night were 15% more likely to have obesity compared
                                        to those who slept seven hours a night</div>
                                    <div>&#160;</div>
                                    <div>Insufficient sleep may also affect the production of appetite-regulating
                                        hormones ghrelin and leptin, which can lead people to feel hungrier throughout
                                        the day. Additionally, poor sleep increases cortisol and can result in
                                        harder-to-lose body and belly fat.</div>

                                    <div>“Most of us can’t control what time we have to get up, but we can control when
                                        we go to bed, so counting back seven to nine hours from the time you have to
                                        wake up is a great tip,” says Darnbrough. “I also encourage the 3-2-1 rule,
                                        which means stop working three hours before bed, stop eating two hours before
                                        bed and stop digital stimuli one hour before bed to improve your deep sleep and

                                        neurotransmitter dopamine—raise levels of oxytocin, the love hormone, either by

                                    <div>Animal studies have found oxytocin reduces calories consumed and has positive
                                        effects on metabolism[15]. A small human study also found that giving men
                                        oxytocin over an eight-week period promoted weight loss</div>
                                    <div>&#160;</div>
                                    <div>“While more research is needed to understand exactly how increasing oxytocin
                                        can impact weight and appetite, if you’re experiencing difficult emotions, a
                                        self-compassion break will allow you to give yourself the care you need so you
                                        will be less likely to eat,” says Albertson. “Remember the acronym ‘HALT,’ which
                                        stands for hungry, angry/anxious, lonely and tired. If you are physiologically
                                        hungry, eat. If you are experiencing difficult emotions, ask, ‘What do I need?’
                                        and give yourself what you truly need. If you’re not hungry, it isn’t food.”
