                                <div>Starting a proper skincare routine is no easy feat. The store aisles are daunting,
                                    the TikTok tips and tricks are conflicting and the skincare product reviews are
                                    endless. Not to mention that everyone has different skin types, formula preferences,
                                    schedules and lifestyles. While there is no one right way to take care of your skin,
                                    we spoke with top dermatologists (the pros who really know) to help you figure out
                                    where to start and what to keep in mind while building the best routine for your
                                    skin.</div>

                                <div>To get the most benefit from a daily skincare regimen, no matter what your skin
                                    type, you should start with three simple steps, according to Ashley Magovern, M.D.,
                                    a dermatologist and owner and founder of Manhattan Dermatology in Manhattan Beach,

                                    <li>Cleanse</li>
                                    <div>&#160;</div>
                                    <li>Treat</li>

                                <div>&#160;</div>
                                <div>You probably already know that cleansing means washing your face and moisturizing
                                    means hydrating your skin, but what does "treating" involve? Well, in addition to
                                    keeping your complexion in tip-top shape, the goal of any good skincare routine is
                                    to target problem areas. So, treating means incorporating serums packed full of
                                    beneficial skincare ingredients like vitamin C, retinol, alpha hydroxy acids and
                                    others, depending on your skin type and the results you want to see. "Adding a
                                    middle step in between the cleansing and moisturizing components is really
                                    important," Dr. Magovern says. "It can make a huge difference over time in the
                                    health, appearance and aging of your skin."

                                <div>Face cleansing should be the first step in any skincare routine, as it clears away
                                    impurities and excess oil that can clog pores and dull skin. But be gentle: “Many
                                    people cleanse too often or use a cleanser that’s overly harsh, which will actually
                                    break down your skin’s protective barrier,” Dr. Magovern says. If you have dry or
                                    sensitive skin, try washing only at night and rinsing your face with water in the
                                    morning.
                                </div>
                                <div>&#160;</div>
                                <div>The best formulas will gently cleanse your skin without stripping it of healthy
                                    oils. “A [good] sulfate- and soap-free cleanser for the face will be pH-balanced and
                                    gentle to maintain the skin’s barrier without stripping,” says Whitney Bowe, M.D., a
                                    dermatologist in New York City and author of The Beauty of Dirty Skin. For everyday

                                    <li><a href="">Oily skin:</a> A foaming or gel cleanser will ensure adequate removal

                                        and oil from your skin; ingredients like niacinamide and salicylic acid can help

                                        that includes
                                        tiny particles called micelles that trap impurities and lift them away without
                                        drying your skin in the process.

                                    fingers, a cotton ball or cloth, and before using other leave-on skincare treatments
                                    like serums and moisturizers. A good toner can help ensure your skin is totally
                                    clean and grime-free, plus give it an extra dose of active ingredients.

                                <div>You don’t need a toner, but swiping one on can be a great way to refresh skin,
                                    remove any residual debris and balance pH, Dr. Magovern says. If you're looking for
                                    additional complexion-purifying and brightening benefits, today's toners are much
                                    more advanced than the drying alcohol- and astringent-based formulas of the past,
                                    packed with skin-boosting benefits that can leave you glowing. Here are the
                                    ingredients you'll want to look for, based on your skin type:

                                        antioxidants like <a href="">vitamin C, vitamin E</a> and green tea, which can

                                <div>A serum tailored to your skin concerns can both treat and protect, delivering
                                    concentrated amounts of powerful ingredients that can address a number of complexion
                                    issues, from wrinkles to dark spots — and if you have multiple concerns, you can use
                                    several different serum formulas. Just be sure to read the labels carefully, because
                                    some serums are best used in the morning, while others are ideal for nighttime.

                                <div>One serum anyone can benefit from in the morning? An antioxidant serum, which will
                                    prevent the formation of free radicals and lessen signs of aging over time. Vitamin
                                    C is considered the gold standard antioxidant. “Everyone should use vitamin C, no
                                    matter what age,” Dr. Magovern says. “It helps reverse a lot of the skin damage we
                                    get from the sun and pollution.” For darker skin tones, hyperpigmentation can be a
                                    common issue, and using a vitamin C serum in the morning can also help mitigate dark
                                    spots, says Jennifer David, D.O., a dermatologist in Philadelphia and founder of

                                    <li><a href="">Hyaluronic acid serums:</a> They draw moisture into the skin,
                                        combatting dryness and
                                        dullness and also plumping skin.</li>
                                    <div>&#160;</div>
                                    <li><a href="">Niacinamide:</a> A form of vitamin B3 that brightens and evens skin
                                        tone, boosts
                                        collagen production and calms inflammation.</li>

                                    <li><a href="">Retinoids:</a> Stimulate cell turnover to increase collagen
                                        production and reduce
                                        wrinkles and hyperpigmentation. Retinol is best used at night.</li>

                                        boost its production to smooth lines and increase skin's firmness.</li>

                                <div>Eye creams are different than face creams because they’re formulated specifically
                                    for the delicate eye area, which ages faster than the rest of your face — and
                                    therefore fall into the "treat" category, too. If you're concerned about fine lines,
                                    wrinkles, a lack of firmness, dark circles or undereye bags, an eye treatment
                                    product is definitely a good option.

                                <div>&#160;</div>
                                <div>To target dark circles, seek out niacinamide or vitamin C; and for puffiness, use a
                                    formula with caffeine, advises Marnie Nussbaum, M.D., a dermatologist in New York
                                    City and clinical instructor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical College. For
                                    wrinkles and sagging, look for formulas with peptides and retinol. In addition,
                                    "vitamin K can help brighten dark undereye circles and hyaluronic acid hydrates dry
                                    skin," says Deanne Mraz Robinson, M.D., a dermatologist in Westport, CT and
                                    assistant clinical professor of dermatology at Yale School of Medicine. To treat
                                    multiple eye area issues, shop for a combo of these ingredients targeted to your
                                    needs.

                                <div>When applying in the morning and at night, lightly tap on a formula targeted to

                                    this delicate area and causing damage.</div>

                                <div>Next come face moisturizers, which keep your skin soft and hydrated and help
                                    strengthen its barrier. If you have oily or acne-prone skin, opt for a lighter
                                    moisturizer during the daytime, such as a lotion or gel that will absorb quickly and
                                    won’t pill under makeup. If your skin is dry, try a thicker formula, like a cream.
                                    Either way, dermatologists recommend moisturizers for all skin types year round,
                                    since hydrating is crucial for keeping skin youthful and healthy. “Look for
                                    ingredients like ceramides or hyaluronic acid, since these ingredients are the
                                    building blocks of moisture retention in skin,” Dr. David explains.

                                    <li>Chemical sunscreens are made with chemical ingredients like avobenzone and
                                        homosalate, which absorb the UV light that comes in contact with skin.</li>

                                    <li>Physical sunscreens (a.k.a. mineral sunscreens) contain mineral ingredients like
                                        zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, which reflect UV light off of skin.</li>

                                <div>First, remove the day's makeup and grime. Start by applying a separate makeup
                                    remover, if needed, to take off any cosmetics. “Cleansers are not necessarily
                                    designed to dissolve makeup, especially on eyes, and haven’t done so effectively in
                                    our testing,” says GH Beauty Lab Senior Chemist Sabina Wizemann. Follow with the
                                    same cleanser as in the morning, working from the inside of the face up, then out
                                    and down along the hairline and perimeter to just underneath the chin, she suggests.

                                    <div>If you’re opting for a toner, apply it the same way you would in the morning.
                                        Because they’re liquids, toners should go on before heavier formulas like serums
                                        and moisturizers so they can absorb into skin.</div>

                                    <div>Night is an ideal time to use products with ingredients that slough off dead
                                        skin cells or stimulate cell turnover while you sleep, such as alpha hydroxy
                                        acids like glycolic acid or retinol, Dr. Magovern says. These smooth texture,
                                        brighten skin and minimize pores. (Some serums can be used day or night; follow
                                        the packaging instructions.) If you’re treating hyperpigmentation, alternate
                                        between a retinoid and the spot-fading active ingredient hydroquinone, Dr. David
                                        recommends.</div>

                                    <div>Gently dab an eye cream, or alternatively a bit of your face serum or
                                        treatment, around your eyes. “You don’t have to use a lot, but if you start
                                        training your skin to tolerate more active products around the eye, you’ll see
                                        more change,” Dr. Magovern explains.</div>

                                    <div>If you currently have a blemish (or a few), apply an acne treatment at this
                                        time. For chronic breakouts, be proactive rather than treating pimples as they
                                        pop up, Dr. Magovern advises. “If you just treat the spot, you’ll get acne right
                                        next to it if your skin is clogged,” she says. “You’re getting breakouts because
                                        oil is building up, so be consistent with your regimen to keep pores all over
                                        your face clear.” (If using a retinoid, let skin adjust before trying acne
                                        formulas like salicylic acid.)</div>

                                    <div>Moisturizing is especially crucial at night, as it creates a barrier that seals
                                        in skin’s natural hydration and any active ingredients to counteract moisture
                                        loss that happens as you sleep. But while you can use the same non-SPF day
                                        moisturizer at night, using a night-specific formula will have targeted
                                        anti-aging benefits, repairing damage from the day. "Where regular moisturizers
                                        focus on improving the natural moisture barrier of the skin only, night creams
                                        contain active ingredients that assist with improving the skin beyond adding
                                        moisture," explains Tonya McLeod, M.D., a dermatologist in Charlotte, North
                                        Carolina.</div>

                                    <div>It's not a necessary step, but if your skin is still feeling parched, applying
                                        a face oil can be a great way to help lock in moisture overnight. “A lot of
                                        people think that if they have acne or oily skin, they’ll break out with an oil,
                                        but it’s not true,” Dr. Magovern explains. “It can actually really help soften
                                        skin.” For a nourishing boost, pat on a face oil as a last step once the rest of
                                        your leave-on skincare products dry — just be sure to apply by pressing it into
                                        your skin, not rubbing it in.</div>
